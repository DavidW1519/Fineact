= Connection pool configuration

Please check `application.properties` to see which connection pool settings can be tweaked. The associated environment variables are prefixed with `FINERACT_HIKARI_*`. You can find more information about specific connection pool settings (Hikari) at https://github.com/brettwooldridge/HikariCP#configuration-knobs-baby

NOTE: we'll keep backwards compatibility until one of the next releases to ensure that things are working as expected. Environment variables prefixed `fineract_tenants_*` can still be used to configure the database connection, but we strongly encourage using `FINERACT_HIKARI_*` with more options.
