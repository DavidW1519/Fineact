= SSL CONFIGURATION

Read also [the HTTPS related doc](fineract-doc/src/docs/en/deployment.adoc#https).

By default SSL is enabled, but all SSL related properties are now tunable. SSL can be turned off by setting the environment variable `FINERACT_SERVER_SSL_ENABLED` to false. If you do that then please make sure to also change the server port to `8080` via the variable `FINERACT_SERVER_PORT`, just for the sake of keeping the conventions.
You can choose now easily a different SSL keystore by setting `FINERACT_SERVER_SSL_KEY_STORE` with a path to a different (not embedded) keystore. The password can be set via `FINERACT_SERVER_SSL_KEY_STORE_PASSWORD`. See the `application.properties` file and the latest Spring Boot documentation (https://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/docs/current/reference/html/application-properties.html) for more details.
