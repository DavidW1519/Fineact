= Download Gradle

The file `gradle/wrapper/gradle-wrapper.jar` binary is checked into this projects Git source repository,
but won't exist in your copy of the Fineract codebase if you downloaded a released source archive from apache.org.
In that case, you need to download it using the commands below:

    wget --no-check-certificate -P gradle/wrapper https://github.com/apache/fineract/raw/develop/gradle/wrapper/gradle-wrapper.jar

(or)

    curl --insecure -L https://github.com/apache/fineract/raw/develop/gradle/wrapper/gradle-wrapper.jar > gradle/wrapper/gradle-wrapper.jar
