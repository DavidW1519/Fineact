= INSTRUCTIONS: How to build a WAR file

1. Clone the repository or download and extract the archive file to your local directory.
2. Run `./gradlew :fineract-war:clean :fineract-war:war` to build a traditional WAR file which will be created at `fineract-war/build/libs` directory.
3. Deploy this WAR to your Tomcat v9 Servlet Container.

We recommend using the JAR instead of the WAR file deployment, because it's much easier.

Note that with the 1.4 release the tenants database pool configuration changed from Tomcat DBCP in XML to an embedded Hikari, configured by environment variables, see above.
