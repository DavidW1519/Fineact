= Dependency Upgrades

This project uses a number of 3rd-party libraries, and this section provides some guidance for their updates. We have set-up link:https://renovate.whitesourcesoftware.com[Renovate's bot] to automatically raise Pull Requests for our review when new dependencies are available link:https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/FINERACT-962[FINERACT-962].

Upgrades sometimes require package name changes.  Changed code should ideally have test coverage.

Our `ClasspathHellDuplicatesCheckRuleTest` detects classes that appear in more than 1 JAR.  If a version bump in link:https://github.com/search?q=repo%3Aapache%2Ffineract+filename%3Abuild.gradle&type=Code&ref=advsearch&l=&l=[`build.gradle`] causes changes in transitives dependencies, then you may have to add related `exclude` to our link:https://github.com/apache/fineract/search?q=dependencies.gradle[`dependencies.gradle`].  Running `./gradlew dependencies` helps to understand what is required.
