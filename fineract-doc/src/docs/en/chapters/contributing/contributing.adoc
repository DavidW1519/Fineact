= Getting Started Guide

Fineract is maintained by a large group of contributors, just like you! Getting started with a mature platform like Fineract can be daunting for new contributors. This guide will help you through your first contribution!

== Read FAQ
** First, have a look at the FAQ on our Wiki link:https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=91554327[here]
** Is this Mifos?
*** The Mifos Initiative, contributed the code that forms the basis of fineract, and it remains involved with a number of front end implementations and other systems that run "on top of" fineract, including a payment hub and API management. Many of the developers are on both listservs. However, Mifos as a separate non-Apache entity is not part of the project as it is considered a "vendor".

== Communication Channels

** Join our Slack Community and subscribe to our Mailing lists.
*** link:mailto:dev-subscribe@fineract.apache.org[Apache Fineract Developers List]: Send a blank email to dev-subscribe@fineract.apache.org
*** link:https://the-asf.slack.com/archives/C4QPZURQQ[Apache Fineract Slack Channel]
*** link:https://bit.ly/mifos-slack[Mifos Slack Channel]: There's an active community of developers on the Mifos Slack channel, and you may consider joining it.

== Communication Guidelines

The Apache Software Foundation (ASF) adage is: *"If it didn't happen on the list, then it didn't happen."*

All communications that happen off-list should be brought back to the list. Normally, you should not discuss things off list, but if you do, then you should summarize it on list.

Example, if you discuss something "off list" on a slack channel, especially one at Mifos slack, then you should summarize that discussion on the dev list (dev@fineract.apache.org). By summarizing it, you are bringing into the official record of the project.

== Dev environment setup:
